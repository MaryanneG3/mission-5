# Z-Fuel Backend

The Z-Fuel Backend service includes three main features, each developed by different team members.

1. The Online Order feature, created by Maryanne, allows users to browse and place orders for products through a seamless API integration with MongoDB.

2. The Fuel Map feature, developed by Rhya, provides users with access to an interactive map that shows fuel stations and their locations, enhancing the user experience for locating fuel services.

3. Lastly, the Fuel Prices feature, created by Caitlin, enables users to view real-time fuel prices, offering transparency and helping customers make informed decisions.

These features work together to provide a comprehensive service to users, leveraging MongoDB and Docker for smooth, containerized deployment.

## üìÅ Prerequisites

- Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
- Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.
- `.env` file (see below for setup).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend folder:

<!-- to do: update db connection info -->

```env
PORT=5002
DB=products
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/zfuel
NODE_ENV=development
```

> Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials.

If you want access to the other databases (fuelMap, fuelPrices), you will need to change the value of the DB variable in the .env file.

For Maryanne's DB (Products):

```env
DB=products
```

For Rhya's DB (Fuel Map):

```env
DB=fuelMap
```

For Caitlin's DB (Fuel Prices):

```env
DB=fuelPrices
```

Make sure to set the correct database in your .env file before starting the server.

### üõ† Clone the Repository and change to backend directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaryanneG3/mission-5.git
cd z-fuel-backend
git switch <branch-name>
```

---

## üöÄ Getting started - Local development

After cloning you can run the app manually:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Getting Started with Docker (Only on Maryanne's Branch : mary)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This setup only works on **`mary`** where Docker support and environment configuration have been implemented.

After cloning switch to branch mary:

```bash
git switch mary
```

### üê≥ Run the App Using Docker

- Ensure you have Docker Desktop running

```bash
docker build -t z-fuel-backend .
docker run -p 5002:5002 --name z-fuel-backend-container zfuel-backend

```

### üßπ Cleanup Docker Resources
