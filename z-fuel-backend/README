# Z-Fuel Backend – Order Online Service

This is the backend service for Z-Fuel's "Order Online" feature, allowing users to fetch categories and product data via API. The service connects to MongoDB and is containerized using Docker.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Docker Only on Maryanne's Branch : mary)

> ⚠️ This setup only works on **Maryanne's branch** where Docker support and environment configuration have been implemented.

### 📁 Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Git installed to clone the repository.
- `.env` file (see below for setup).

---

### 🛠 Clone the Repository and Switch to Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaryanneG3/mission-5.git
cd z-fuel-backend
git switch mary
```

---

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend folder:

<!-- to do: update db connection info -->

```env
PORT=5002
DB=products
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/zfuel
NODE_ENV=development
```

> Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials.

---

### 🐳 Run the App Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t zfuel-order-online-backend .
docker run -p 5002:5002 --env-file .env zfuel-order-online-backend

### 🧪 Local Development Tip (Optional)

cd z-fuel-backend
git switch mary
npm install
npm run dev
```
